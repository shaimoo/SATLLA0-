## Introduction
The CubeCell AB02 is a compact LoRaWAN development board based on the ASR6501 MCU, which integrates an RF transceiver for long-range communication. It is designed to be easy to use and supports various sensors and peripherals, making it suitable for a wide range of IoT applications.

## Hardware Setup
Connect the CubeCell AB02 to your computer using a micro USB cable.<br>
Ensure that the board is powered on.


## Software Setup
Install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) if you haven't already done so.<br>
Launch the Arduino IDE.<br>
Go to File -> Preferences and in the Additional Boards Manager URLs field, enter the following URL: https://github.com/heltec-automation/cubecell-arduino/raw/master/package_CubeCell_index.json<br>
Click OK to save the preferences.<br>
Go to Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager.<br>
In the Boards Manager window, search for "CubeCell" and click on the CubeCell entry that appears.<br>
Click on Install to install the CubeCell boards package.<br>
Once the installation is complete, close the Boards Manager window.<br>

## Getting Started with Arduino IDE
Connect the CubeCell AB02 to your computer if it's not already connected.<br>
Launch the Arduino IDE.<br>
Go to Tools -> Board and select CubeCell-Board.<br>
Go to Tools -> Port and select the appropriate COM port for the CubeCell AB02.<br>
Open the Blink example sketch by going to File -> Examples -> 01.Basics -> Blink.<br>
Verify that the Board and Port settings are correct.<br>
Click on the Upload button to compile and upload the sketch to the CubeCell AB02.<br>
Once the upload is complete, the LED on the board should start blinking.<br>

## LoRaWAN Configuration
Open the OTAA example sketch by going to File -> Examples -> LoRa -> LoRaWAN_OTAA.<br>
Configure the LoRaWAN parameters in the sketch, including APP_EUI, APP_KEY, DEV_EUI, and LORAWAN_REGION. Refer to your LoRaWAN network provider's documentation for these values.<br>
Verify that the Board and Port settings are still correct.<br>
Click on the Upload button to compile and upload the sketch to the CubeCell AB02.<br>
Once the upload is complete, open the Serial Monitor by going to Tools -> Serial Monitor.<br>
Set the baud rate to 115200 and ensure that the line ending is set to Newline.<br>
You should see the device joining the LoRaWAN network and displaying the relevant information in the Serial Monitor.<br>

## Sample Code
The CubeCell AB02 comes with a variety of example sketches that demonstrate different functionalities. To access the examples, go to File -> Examples -> LoRa or CubeCell and explore the available sketches. These examples cover topics such as sensor readings, GPS, LoRaWAN communication, and more.
